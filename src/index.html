            <p>Hello, World! I am a software engineer.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Dnipro University of Technology (NTU DP) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2004. I began a Master's program but left midway after receiving a job offer, as gaining real-world experience became my priority.</p>
            <p>I started my career at a small company as a C++ programmer. Due to strong demand for web developers, I expanded my skill set into web technologies and have since grown into a successful ASP.NET full-stack software engineer.</p>
            <p>I have wide experience with a variety of technologies and stacks, including ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Docker. My primary programming languages are C# and TypeScript, and I also enjoy working with Python and C++.</p>
            <p>I have over 20 years of experience working as a software engineer with ASP.NET technologies. I have strong front-end skills, including JavaScript and TypeScript, and hands-on experience with frameworks such as Angular and React. The HTML and CSS I write follow W3C standards.</p>
            <p>I use modern AI tools like GitHub Copilot in my daily work, which helps speed up routine tasks and gives me more time to focus on finding the best solutions.</p>
            <p>My specialties is Asp.Net full-stack software engineer.</p>
