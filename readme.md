## 

Hello, World! I am a software engineer.

I graduated from Dnipro University of Technology (NTU DP) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2004. I began a Master's program but left midway after receiving a job offer, as gaining real-world experience became my priority.

I started my career at a small company as a C++ programmer. Due to strong demand for web developers, I expanded my skill set into web technologies and have since grown into a successful ASP.NET full-stack software engineer.

I have wide experience with a variety of technologies and stacks, including ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Docker. My primary programming languages are C# and TypeScript, and I also enjoy working with Python and C++.

I have over 20 years of experience working as a software engineer with ASP.NET technologies. I have strong front-end skills, including JavaScript and TypeScript, and hands-on experience with frameworks such as Angular and React. The HTML and CSS I write follow W3C standards.

I use modern AI tools like GitHub Copilot in my daily work, which helps speed up routine tasks and gives me more time to focus on finding the best solutions.

My specialties is Asp.Net full-stack software engineer.
